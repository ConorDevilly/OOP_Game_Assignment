# OOP_Game_Assignment
This repository stores code for a game created for a Object Orientated Programming Assignment

The game I've made is based on the [1983 Star Wars Atari game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_%281983_video_game%29)

When you start up, there's a brief introduction / story done in the style of Star Wars film introductions.
Press space or enter to skip it.
From there you can see the menu. Click "Play" to play or "Highscores" to see the top 5 highscores.

Gameplay is very simple.
See a Tie Fighter? Aim with the mouse and press space to shoot.
See a Tie Fighter shoot a weird orange sphere at you? That's an ememy bomb. Shoot it or your shield will lose power.
If your shield gets to 0 you'll die. You can then enter your name. 
Check the highscores screen after to see if you got a high score!
